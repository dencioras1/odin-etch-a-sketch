This is my rendition of the Etch-A-Sketch project for TOP.

I was getting carried away a little working on it :P
Currently everything works except for the 'download' button, I was trying to 
add the ability to download PNGs but they for some reason come out as very blurry.

Pretty sure if you click the button, in the console you can see a PNG URL, which you can open
in a separate tab.
